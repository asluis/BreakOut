**BreakOut**


Breakout using Java.


The player controls a paddle and is supposed to destroy all bricks that are on the top section of the panel while also
preventing the ball from hitting the bottom section of the panel. If all bricks are destroyed, the player wins. In
contrast, if the ball hits the bottom panel, the player will lose.
